	<p>Being the real you is the best thing anytime and anywhere because in a world of black and white, your true colours will still show. That is why I have decided that I'll be known for who I am wherever I go. Moreover, there is never a second chance to make first impressions.</p>
	<p>My name is Ogunleye Miracle Olamide, popularly known and called by the name MIMI. Everybody loves me. I like to move and talk to guys better than girls.</p>
